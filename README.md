Hi, I’m Salah AlHaismawi.

I’m an applied machine learning engineer focused on training, debugging, and deploying deep learning systems, with a particular interest in LLMs and ML infrastructure.

I’ve trained language models from scratch under tight compute constraints, worked through real training failure modes (plateaus, instability, wasted runs), and built tooling to make model training more reliable and efficient. My work spans model training, performance optimization, and the supporting infrastructure needed to ship ML systems in practice.

I enjoy building practical tools, contributing to open source, and working close to the systems layer where models actually succeed or fail.
